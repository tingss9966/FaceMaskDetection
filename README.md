# FaceMaskDetection
This is a project for CSC413.\
It has been 2 years since COVID-19 entered into our lives. Most of us have gotten used to washing our hands often, wearing a mask, physical distancing, and other things to protect ourselves from the virus. A lot of places depend on people wearing masks to protect the people with weaker immune systems like hospitals and retirement homes, or to prevent a mass spread of the virus like in food factories. These facilities wonâ€™t always have people to ensure people wears mask. So, we want to train an algorithm that can detect if a person is wearing a mask, not wearing a mask, or wearing a mask incorrectly. And using this model we will apply it to videos or security cameras that is able to detect face masks in real time.\

1. LoadData: Preprocess the data and save and the process images to a .npz file.
2. WithBackBone: run two models with backbone to compare accuracy and run time
3. cnn: convolution network with 8 million parameters face detection classifier
4. videoFD: run to see application of this classifier. Note: Need to run at least WithBackbone or cnn first)
